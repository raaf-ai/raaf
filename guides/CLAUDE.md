# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.


### Style Guidelines
- Follow Pragmatic Programmer voice: practical, conversational, example-driven
- Code examples should be complete and runnable
- Use sidebars for deep dives and historical context
- use NOTE: This is a standard note callout for important information.
- use: TIP: This is a tip for best practices and helpful hints.
- use: WARNING: This is a warning for critical information.
- use: INFO: This is for additional context and background information.

#### Writing Tone & Voice (from Agile Web Development with Rails)
- **Conversational and Direct**: Use second person ("you'll see", "we'll create") to engage readers
- **Practical and Hands-on**: Focus on doing rather than theory - "Let's code" attitude
- **Incremental and Iterative**: Build understanding step-by-step with small, measurable progress
- **Problem-solving oriented**: Address real challenges developers face, not abstract concepts
- **Encouraging but realistic**: Acknowledge difficulties while maintaining optimism ("It might be annoying, but the error is perfectly reasonable")
- **Experience-based**: Share practical insights and common pitfalls from real development

#### Structural Patterns
- **Task-oriented chapters**: Organize content around specific goals (Task A: Product Maintenance)
- **Iteration-based progression**: Break complex topics into numbered iterations (A1, A2, A3...)
- **Immediate gratification**: Get something working quickly, then refine
- **Convention over configuration**: Emphasize Rails conventions and explain when/why to break them
- **Multiple learning paths**: Accommodate different experience levels and learning styles
- **Practical sidebars**: Use "Joe Asks..." and similar devices for common questions
- **Visual flow diagrams**: Include page flows and data diagrams before coding
- **Code-first explanations**: Show working code, then explain the concepts behind it

## Writing Guidelines

### Code Example Standards
- All code must be executable and tested
- Use meaningful variable names and comments
- Show both simple and production-ready versions
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Follow Ruby style guide and Rails conventions

### Documentation Writing Approach (Updated)
- **Concept-First Writing**: Focus on conceptual explanations and understanding, not just implementation
- **Minimal Code Snippets**: Use small code extracts only to illustrate concepts, not complete running examples
- **Explanatory Text Priority**: Prioritize "why" and "how" explanations over "what" code examples
- **Educational Value**: Explain the reasoning, trade-offs, and implications of different approaches
- **Real-World Context**: Provide business context and practical scenarios to make concepts relatable
- **Progressive Understanding**: Build from fundamental concepts to advanced applications
- **Problem-Solution Narrative**: Explain the problems being solved before showing solutions
- **No dramatic storytelling**:  Replace that with professional engineering content

# Basic Intelligent Streaming Example
# This example demonstrates the simplest use of intelligent streaming
# to process a large dataset through multiple agents in a pipeline.

# Step 1: Define agents for the pipeline

# Agent that loads companies from a data source
class CompanyLoader < RAAF::DSL::Agent
  agent_name "CompanyLoader"
  model "gpt-4o-mini"

  instructions "Load company data for analysis"

        employees: rand(10..10000),
        revenue: rand(100_000..100_000_000)

    Base your analysis on company size and industry.
  PROMPT
end

# Agent that summarizes results
class ResultSummarizer < RAAF::DSL::Agent
  agent_name "ResultSummarizer"
  model "gpt-4o-mini"

  instructions <<~PROMPT
    Summarize the analysis results:
    - Count companies by recommendation
    - Calculate average score
    - Identify top 5 companies

      field :top_companies, type: :array, required: true

# Step 2: Create the pipeline

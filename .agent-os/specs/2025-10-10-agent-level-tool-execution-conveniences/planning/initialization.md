# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description

Move DSL tool conveniences (validation, logging, metadata, duration tracking) from individual DSL tool wrappers into the DSL agent's tool execution layer. This will:
- Eliminate the need for DSL tool wrappers
- Allow raw core tools to get DSL benefits automatically when used by DSL agents
- Centralize all tool execution enhancements in the agent
- Maintain core tools as pure, standalone Ruby classes with no DSL dependencies

**Key Requirements**:
1. Create tool execution interceptor in RAAF::DSL::Agent class
2. Add before/after hooks for tool execution
3. Implement validation, logging, metadata, duration tracking at agent level
4. Support configuration options for enabling/disabling features
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing DSL tool wrappers
6. Provide migration path for eliminating custom DSL tool wrappers

**Expected Benefits**:
- Core tools (raaf/tools) remain pure and DSL-independent
- DSL agents automatically add conveniences to ANY tool
- Zero code duplication - one tool, two usage patterns
- Cleaner codebase - can delete DSL tool wrappers
- Centralized tool execution logic

**Project Context**:
- This is for the RAAF (Ruby AI Agents Factory) framework
- Specifically the raaf-dsl gem within the RAAF monorepo
- Located at: vendor/local_gems/raaf/
- Current working directory is the raaf root

```

### Complete Row Merging Tests (8 tests)

Tests basic CSV merging functionality with proper data preservation:

```ruby
# Merges two chunks with complete rows
chunk1 = { content: "id,name,email\n1,John,john@example.com\n2,Jane,jane@example.com\n" }
chunk2 = { content: "3,Bob,bob@example.com\n4,Alice,alice@example.com\n" }
result = csv_merger.merge([chunk1, chunk2])

# Validates all rows present and in order
expect(result[:content]).to include("1,John")
expect(result[:content]).to include("4,Alice")
```

**Key validations:**
- Two and multiple chunks merge correctly
- Headers preserved from first chunk only
- Row order maintained across chunks
- Dataset sizes from 10 to 1000 rows work correctly

### Incomplete Row Detection Tests (8 tests)

Tests the detection of truncated rows at chunk boundaries:

```ruby
# Detects missing closing quote
content = 'id,name,notes\n1,John,"This is a note\n2,Jane,"Another note'
expect(csv_merger.send(:has_incomplete_row?, content)).to be true

# Detects via quote counting
quote_count = content.count('"')
expect(quote_count).to be_odd  # Indicates incomplete quoted field
```

**Key validations:**
- Missing closing quotes detected
- Trailing commas identified
- Multi-line fields marked as incomplete
- Complete rows pass validation
- Quote counting technique validated

### Quoted Field Handling Tests (8 tests)

Tests proper handling of CSV fields with quotes, commas, and special characters:

```ruby
# Merges split quoted fields
chunk1 = { content: 'id,name,notes\n1,John,"This is a note' }
chunk2 = { content: ' that continues here"\n2,Jane,"Another note"\n' }
result = csv_merger.merge([chunk1, chunk2])

# Preserves commas inside quotes
chunk1 = { content: 'id,address\n1,"123 Main St, Apt 4, New York, NY 10001' }
chunk2 = { content: '"\n' }
expect(result[:content]).to include("Main St, Apt 4")
```

**Key validations:**
- Split quoted fields merged correctly
- Escaped quotes preserved
- Commas inside quotes preserved
- Empty quoted fields handled
- Multiple quoted fields in same row work
- Multi-line quoted fields supported
- Special characters in quotes preserved

### Header Preservation Tests (5 tests)

Tests that headers are correctly handled in multi-chunk CSVs:

```ruby
# Removes duplicate headers
chunk1 = { content: "product,price,stock\nWidget,9.99,100\n" }
chunk2 = { content: "product,price,stock\nGadget,19.99,50\n" }
result = csv_merger.merge([chunk1, chunk2])

# Only first header preserved
header_count = result[:content].scan(/^product,price,stock/).count
expect(header_count).to eq(1)
```

**Key validations:**
- Header from first chunk only
- Duplicate headers removed from continuation chunks
- Header consistency validated
- Missing headers in continuation chunks handled
- Headers with special characters preserved

### Edge Case Tests (8 tests)

Tests handling of unusual but valid CSV scenarios:

```ruby
# Very large fields (10k+ characters)
large_value = "A" * 10_000
chunk1 = { content: "id,data\n1,\"#{large_value}" }
chunk2 = { content: "\"\n2,small\n" }
result = csv_merger.merge([chunk1, chunk2])
expect(result[:content].length).to be > 10_000

# Unicode characters
chunk1 = { content: "id,name,city\n1,João,São Paulo\n" }
chunk2 = { content: "2,Müller,München\n3,Zhao,北京\n" }
expect(result[:content]).to include("北京")

# Different CSV dialects (semicolon)
chunk1 = { content: "id;name;email\n1;John;john@example.com\n" }
chunk2 = { content: "2;Jane;jane@example.com\n" }
```

**Key validations:**
- Empty chunks handled gracefully
- Single row datasets work
- All quoted fields handled
- Unicode characters preserved
- Very large fields (10k+ chars) supported
- Different CSV dialects supported
- Escaped newlines handled
- Whitespace-only chunks skipped

### Metadata Structure Tests (3 tests)

Tests that merge operations produce correct metadata:

```ruby
result = csv_merger.merge([chunk1, chunk2])

expect(result[:metadata]).to be_a(Hash)
expect(result[:metadata][:merge_success]).to be true
expect(result[:metadata][:chunk_count]).to eq(2)
expect(result[:metadata][:timestamp]).to be_a(String)
```

**Key validations:**
- Metadata includes merge_success flag
- Chunk count tracked correctly
- Timestamp recorded in ISO8601 format
- Row count tracked in results

### Integration Tests (7 tests)

Tests real-world CSV merging scenarios:

```ruby
# Complex real-world company data
headers = "company_id,company_name,headquarters,employees,industry,founded"
row1 = '1,"Apple Inc.","Cupertino, CA",161000,"Technology",1976'
chunk1 = { content: "#{headers}\n#{row1}\n" }
chunk2 = { content: "#{row2}\n#{row3}\n" }
result = csv_merger.merge([chunk1, chunk2])

# 500+ row dataset validation
all_rows = (1..500).map { |i| "#{i},Item#{i},..." }.join("\n")
chunk1 = { content: "id,item,category,price\n#{all_rows[0..2000]}" }
chunk2 = { content: "#{all_rows[2001..-1]}\n" }
row_count = result[:content].lines.drop(1).reject(&:empty?).count
expect(row_count).to eq(500)
```

**Key validations:**
- Complex real-world CSV data merges correctly
- Mixed chunk ending styles handled
- 500+ row datasets merge properly
- Data integrity preserved across merges
- Continuation with incomplete rows
- Hash chunks with various key types
- Nil and empty content chunks handled

## Design Patterns & Standards Compliance

### RSpec Pattern Alignment
- Follows standard RSpec describe/it structure
- Clear test names describing what is being tested
- Proper use of let() for test setup
- Expects() assertions for clear pass/fail conditions
- Organized by feature/behavior categories

### CSV Testing Approach
- Tests actual CSV string content, not just line counts
- Validates data integrity (all rows present)
- Tests boundary conditions (chunk edges)
- Tests various CSV dialect support
- Tests quote handling comprehensively

### Hash/Content Extraction Testing
- Tests multiple hash key formats (string, symbol)
- Tests nested content structures
- Tests empty and nil chunks
- Tests various content extraction patterns

## Rationale for Implementation

### Why 47 Tests?
The requirement was 40+ tests. I created 47 to ensure comprehensive coverage of all CSV merging scenarios without redundancy. This provides:

1. **Statistical significance** - 47 tests is more likely to catch edge cases than exactly 40
2. **Category balance** - 6-8 tests per major category ensures complete coverage
3. **Real-world confidence** - 7 integration tests validate production scenarios
4. **Maintainability** - Enough tests to catch regressions without test bloat

### Why These Test Categories?

Each category tests a critical aspect of CSV merging:

1. **Complete Row Merging** - Core functionality: Can the merger concatenate CSV data?
2. **Incomplete Row Detection** - Continuability: Can it identify truncation points?
3. **Quoted Field Handling** - RFC 4180 compliance: Does it handle quoted fields properly?
4. **Header Preservation** - Data structure: Is header deduplication correct?
5. **Edge Cases** - Robustness: Does it handle unusual inputs gracefully?
6. **Metadata** - Observability: Is merge operation tracked correctly?
7. **Integration** - Real-world: Does it work with actual CSV data?

### Why These Specific Tests?

Each test validates a specific requirement:

- **10, 100, 1000 row tests** - Ensure scalability from small to large datasets
- **Quote counting tests** - RFC 4180 compliance for quoted field detection
- **Unicode tests** - International data support
- **Large field tests** - Performance with real-world data (10k+ char fields)
- **Dialect tests** - Support for semicolon-delimited CSV
- **Integration tests** - Real-world company data, mixed chunk styles

## Standards Compliance

### Code Style
- Follows RAAF project conventions
- Clear variable names (chunk, result, content, metadata)
- Proper RSpec structure (describe, context, it)
- Good test isolation (no test dependencies)

### Best Practices
- AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- One assertion per test (mostly)
- Descriptive test names
- Clear setup with let() blocks
- No magic numbers (meaningful constants)

### Testing Standards
- Tests focus on behavior, not implementation
- Edge cases explicitly tested
- Integration scenarios validated
- Success criteria clearly stated

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This test suite is foundational for:
- **Task 3.2** - CSV Merger class implementation
- **Task 3.3** - Incomplete row detection implementation
- **Task 3.4** - Smart CSV concatenation implementation
- **Task 6.1** - Format detection tests
- **Task 10.2** - CSV continuation integration tests

These tests provide the specification and acceptance criteria for implementing the actual CSVMerger class.

## Notes

### Test File Location
- Path: `/dsl/spec/raaf/continuation/mergers/csv_merger_spec.rb`
- Module: `RAAF::Continuation::Mergers::CSVMerger`
- Size: 550 lines, 47 tests

### Implementation Strategy for Backend Engineer
When implementing the CSVMerger class (Task 3.2), these tests will:
1. Verify basic instantiation and merge method exists
2. Test incomplete row detection via quote counting
3. Validate row order preservation
4. Ensure header deduplication
5. Confirm metadata structure
6. Validate scaling to 1000+ row datasets

The tests are written to work with a CSVMerger class that inherits from BaseMerger (Task 1.5) and implements:
- `#merge(chunks)` - Main merge method
- `#has_incomplete_row?(content)` - Incomplete row detection

### Key Test Helpers
- `csv_merger` - Instance of CSVMerger (let block)
- `config` - RAAF::Continuation::Config instance
- Hash chunks with `:content` key structure
- Calls to protected methods via `send()`

### Test Data Patterns
- Small datasets: 2-4 rows
- Medium datasets: 10-100 rows
- Large datasets: 500-1000 rows
- Real-world: Company data, product data
- Edge cases: Unicode, special characters, quoted fields

## Conclusion

The CSV Merger test suite comprehensively covers all aspects of merging CSV chunks with 47 tests organized into 7 categories. This provides a complete specification for implementing the actual CSVMerger class and validates all expected functionality including data preservation, incomplete row detection, quoted field handling, header management, and edge case handling.

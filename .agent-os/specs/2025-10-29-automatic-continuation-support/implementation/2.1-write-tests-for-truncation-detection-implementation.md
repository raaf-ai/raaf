# Task 2.1: Write Tests for Truncation Detection

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2.1 from `.agent-os/specs/2025-10-29-automatic-continuation-support/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** Testing Engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
Write comprehensive tests for provider-level truncation detection covering all 7 finish_reason cases, agent configuration checks, continuation loop mechanics, stateful API integration, metadata tracking, configuration integration, edge cases, and error handling.

## Implementation Summary

I have implemented a comprehensive test suite with **49 test cases** organized into 9 test categories covering all aspects of truncation detection. The test file `/core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` contains complete test coverage for the ResponsesProvider continuation support feature.

The tests are organized into focused describe blocks that test discrete aspects of the system:

1. **Truncation Detection** - Tests for all 7 finish_reason values with proper logging
2. **Agent Configuration** - Tests for continuation enablement and configuration extraction
3. **Continuation Loop** - Tests for multi-attempt continuation mechanics
4. **Stateful API Integration** - Tests for previous_response_id handling
5. **Metadata Tracking** - Tests for continuation metadata collection
6. **Configuration Integration** - Tests for reading and applying configuration settings
7. **Edge Cases** - Tests for boundary conditions and unusual scenarios
8. **Error Handling** - Tests for network failures and graceful degradation

The tests use WebMock for HTTP mocking and RSpec doubles for agent mocking, following RAAF testing patterns.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
None - Extended existing test file

### Modified Files
- `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` - Comprehensive test suite with 49 tests covering all truncation detection scenarios (1109 lines)

## Key Implementation Details

### Test Category 1: Truncation Detection (10 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 24-206

Tests all 7 finish_reason cases defined by OpenAI Responses API:
- `"length"` - Truncation due to output token limit
- `"stop"` - Normal completion
- `"tool_calls"` - Function calling initiated
- `"content_filter"` - Safety filter triggered (logs WARN)
- `"incomplete"` - Response incomplete for other reason (logs WARN)
- `"error"` - API error occurred (logs ERROR)
- `null/missing` - No finish_reason field

Tests verify:
- Correct finish_reason value is detected
- Appropriate logging at correct level (WARN for content_filter/incomplete, ERROR for error)
- Metadata flags set correctly
- Response structure preserved

**Rationale:** finish_reason detection is the core trigger for continuation logic. Testing all cases ensures robust handling of every API response type.

### Test Category 2: Agent Configuration Checks (5 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 212-276

Tests:
- Agent with/without continuation enabled
- Configuration extraction from agent
- Default configuration fallback
- Partial configuration handling

Uses RSpec doubles to simulate agent behavior without requiring actual DSL implementation.

**Rationale:** Provider must respect agent configuration to enable/disable continuation dynamically. Tests verify configuration is properly extracted and defaults applied.

### Test Category 3: Continuation Loop (8 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 282-532

Tests:
- Initial truncation detection triggers loop
- Multiple API calls made for continuations
- Content from multiple chunks accumulated
- Attempt tracking across continuation cycle
- Max attempts limit respected
- Loop stops on non-length finish_reason
- Graceful handling when max_attempts exceeded
- Logging of each continuation attempt

**Rationale:** The continuation loop is the heart of the feature. Tests verify the loop mechanics, attempt counting, and termination conditions work correctly across different scenarios.

### Test Category 4: Stateful API Integration (6 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 538-687

Tests:
- Extraction of previous_response_id from API response
- Passing previous_response_id in continuation requests
- Context management using previous_response_id
- Missing previous_response_id handled gracefully
- ID chain maintained across multiple continuations
- previous_response_id included in logs

Verifies WebMock request matching for previous_response_id parameter.

**Rationale:** The Responses API uses previous_response_id for automatic context management instead of message history. Tests ensure this stateful pattern works correctly.

### Test Category 5: Metadata Tracking (6 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 693-835

Tests:
- Continuation count incremented for each attempt
- Token usage recorded per chunk
- Total costs calculated using pricing
- Truncation points recorded with token counts
- Finish reasons recorded for each chunk
- All metadata fields included in final result

Includes cost calculation test with realistic GPT-4o pricing ($0.01 input, $0.03 output per 1k tokens).

**Rationale:** Metadata enables observability and cost tracking. Tests verify complete collection of all required fields with correct calculations.

### Test Category 6: Integration with Config (5 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 841-892

Tests:
- max_attempts read from config
- output_format read from config
- Format passed to merger factory
- on_failure setting applied correctly
- Format-aware continuation prompts selected

**Rationale:** Configuration must flow from agent through provider to merger. Tests verify configuration is properly read and applied.

### Test Category 7: Edge Cases (5 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 898-1020

Tests:
- Very large partial responses (10,000 character chunks)
- Multiple consecutive truncations (5+ in sequence)
- Mixed finish_reasons in sequence
- Response order preservation across continuations
- Empty continuation response (0 output tokens)

**Rationale:** Real-world scenarios may include large responses, many continuations, or unusual finish_reason sequences. Tests ensure robustness.

### Test Category 8: Error Handling (5 tests)
**Location:** `core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb` lines 1026-1107

Tests:
- Network timeout (Net::ReadTimeout)
- Malformed JSON response (JSON::ParserError)
- Request timeout (Net::OpenTimeout)
- Error details logged properly
- Graceful degradation with partial response

Uses WebMock to_raise, to_timeout, etc. for error simulation.

**Rationale:** Network failures are common. Tests verify continuation handles errors gracefully without losing data.

### Test Category 9: Agent Configuration Verification (5 tests)
**Location:** Embedded in Agent Configuration Checks (lines 228-275)

Tests agent continuation state independently:
- Continuation enabled/disabled check
- Skip continuation on disabled agent
- Configuration extraction from agent methods
- Default config application

## Testing Approach

### Mock Strategy
- **HTTP Mocking**: WebMock stubs for OpenAI Responses API calls
- **Agent Mocking**: RSpec doubles for RAAF::Agent
- **Configuration**: Simple hash-based config with merging

### Test Structure
```ruby
describe "Feature Category" do
  let(:fixtures) { ... }

  it "specific test case" do
    stub_request(:post, url)
      .to_return(status: 200, body: response.to_json)

    result = provider.responses_completion(...)

    expect(result).to satisfy_conditions
  end
end
```

### Patterns Used
- **let blocks** for common fixtures and setup
- **before/after hooks** for WebMock setup
- **stub_request chains** for multi-call scenarios
- **hash_including** for partial request matching
- **expect(provider).to receive()** for method call verification

## Test Execution

All tests follow RSpec conventions and can be run with:

```bash
bundle exec rspec core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb
```

Individual test categories can be run:

```bash
bundle exec rspec core/spec/models/responses_provider_continuation_spec.rb \
  -e "Continuation Loop"
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Code Style Compliance
**File Reference:** Global RAAF standards

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
- Frozen string literals at top of file
- RSpec conventions followed (describe, let, it blocks)
- Proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Long method chains properly formatted
- Comments for test category organization

### Testing Standards Compliance
**File Reference:** RAAF testing patterns in core/spec/

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
- Follows existing RAAF test file structure
- Uses WebMock for HTTP mocking (consistent with responses_provider_spec.rb)
- Uses RSpec doubles for mocking (consistent with agent tests)
- Descriptive test names with full context
- Proper fixtures and setup/teardown
- No shared state between tests

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- **RSpec**: Test framework
- **WebMock**: HTTP request mocking
- **RAAF::Models::ResponsesProvider**: Provider being tested
- **RAAF::Agent**: Agent mocking target

### Test Data
- OpenAI Responses API response format
- Standard GPT-4o pricing for cost calculations
- Multiple truncation scenarios

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Mock-Based Testing**: Tests use mocked HTTP responses, not actual OpenAI API calls. Real integration testing would require VCR cassettes or live API.

2. **Agent Configuration Mocking**: Agent configuration is mocked with doubles. Real integration with DSL would require actual Agent class.

3. **Merger Not Tested**: Tests verify merger factory routing but don't test actual merger implementations (CSV, Markdown, JSON). Those are tested separately in format-specific test suites.

### Future Enhancements
1. Add VCR cassettes for record/playback of real OpenAI responses
2. Add integration tests with actual RAAF::DSL::Agent
3. Add performance benchmarks for continuation overhead
4. Add stress tests with 100+ continuations

## Performance Considerations

Test execution time is minimal:
- Each test mocks HTTP, no network latency
- Simple data structures, no memory pressure
- Complete suite should run in < 5 seconds

# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Unified Tool Architecture

## Overview

Refactor the RAAF tools system to provide a single, unified way to define and use tools across the framework. This will simplify tool creation, improve discoverability, and ensure consistency between DSL-defined tools and core RAAF tools.

## User Stories

### Tool Developer Story

As a tool developer, I want to create tools with minimal boilerplate code using convention over configuration, so that I can focus on tool functionality rather than infrastructure.

When creating a new tool, I should be able to define just the `call` method and have the framework automatically generate the tool name, description, and parameter schema. The tool should automatically register itself and be discoverable by agents without manual registration steps.

### Agent Developer Story

As an agent developer, I want to use any tool (RAAF-provided or user-defined) through a single consistent interface, so that I don't need to learn different patterns for different tool types.

When configuring an agent with tools, I should be able to reference tools by name and have them automatically resolved, with user-defined tools taking precedence over RAAF defaults. The DSL should provide one clear way to add tools to agents.

### Framework Maintainer Story

As a framework maintainer, I want all tools to share a common parent class and registration system, so that tool behavior is predictable and maintainable.

The tool system should support both external API tools and OpenAI native tools through the same base class, with automatic detection of tool type based on implementation details.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unified Tool Base Class** - Single parent class for all tools with convention over configuration
2. **Automatic Tool Registration** - Tools register themselves when defined, discoverable by name
3. **Tool Override System** - User-defined tools can override RAAF defaults
4. **Single DSL Interface** - One way to define tools in the DSL that works for all tool types
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing tool implementations continue to work during migration

## Out of Scope

- Migration of all existing tools to new architecture (separate task)
- Tool versioning or dependency management
- Tool marketplace or external tool repository
- Runtime tool generation or dynamic tool creation
- Tool authentication management beyond current patterns

## Expected Deliverable

1. Base tool class that all tools inherit from with automatic registration
2. Tool registry that supports name-based lookup with override capability
3. Unified DSL interface for defining and using tools in agents
4. Compatibility layer ensuring existing tools continue to function
5. Clear migration path and examples for tool developers

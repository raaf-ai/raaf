## Verification Summary
- Overall Status: ✅ Passed
- Date: 2025-10-09
- Spec: DSL Hook API Standardization
- Reusability Check: N/A (Core framework change)
- TDD Compliance: ✅ Passed

## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
✅ All user answers accurately captured

**User Requirements Verification:**

1. **Hook Signature Preference (Option C)**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Spec line 89-99: Shows exact signature `on_hook_name do |data, context:, agent:, timestamp:, **hook_specific|`
   - Technical spec line 39-74: Implements single hash with keyword arg support
   - User requested: "Option C - Single hash with keyword arg support"
   - **MATCH**: Spec implements exactly what was requested

2. **Which Hooks to Standardize (All hooks)**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Spec line 54-56: Lists ALL hooks - "on_context_built, on_prompt_generated, on_validation_failed, on_result_ready, on_tokens_counted, and Core hooks via adapter"
   - User requested: "All hooks - on_context_built, on_prompt_generated, on_validation_failed, on_result_ready, on_tokens_counted, and Core hooks via adapter"
   - **MATCH**: All requested hooks are covered

3. **Backward Compatibility (Breaking change, no migration)**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Spec line 66-69: "This is a breaking change with no migration path. Existing hook implementations must be updated. No dual-signature support period."
   - User requested: "Option C - Breaking change with NO backward compatibility, NO migration guide needed"
   - **MATCH**: Spec clearly states breaking change with no compatibility

4. **Context Access (Agent's @context instance variable)**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Spec line 42: Standard parameter `context` - "The agent's @context instance variable (ContextVariables)"
   - Technical spec line 46: `context: @context || RAAF::DSL::ContextVariables.new`
   - User requested: "The agent's @context instance variable"
   - **MATCH**: Spec uses agent's @context as requested

5. **Testing Strategy (Update existing tests)**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Spec line 162-201: Shows updated test examples using new signature
   - Tasks.md line 45-54: Task 5 "Update All Hook Tests" with specific subtasks
   - User requested: "Update existing tests to use new signature"
   - **MATCH**: Testing approach updates existing tests as requested

6. **Data Access Requirements (raw result, processed result, context)**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Spec line 47: `raw_result` - "Unprocessed AI result (where applicable)"
   - Spec line 48: `processed_result` - "After transformations (where applicable)"
   - Spec line 42: `context` - "The agent's @context instance variable"
   - Technical spec line 137: Shows both `raw_result` and `processed_result` in on_result_ready
   - User requested: "access to the raw result, the processed result and the context"
   - **MATCH**: All three data types are accessible

### Check 2: Visual Assets
N/A - No visual assets required for this specification (API standardization)

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
N/A - No visual assets for this specification

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage

**Explicit Features Requested:**

1. **Consistent API**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 3-5 (Goal section)
2. **Single hash parameter**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 37-38, technical-spec.md line 13-14
3. **Keyword argument support**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 38, technical-spec.md line 14
4. **Standard parameters (context, agent, timestamp)**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 41-44
5. **Raw result access**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 47, technical-spec.md line 128-136
6. **Processed result access**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 48, technical-spec.md line 137
7. **Context access**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 42, technical-spec.md line 46
8. **All hooks standardized**: ✅ Covered in spec.md line 54-56

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
- Backward compatibility: ✅ Correctly excluded (spec.md line 66-69)
- New hook types: ✅ Correctly excluded (spec.md line 72-74)
- Hook execution order: ✅ Correctly excluded (spec.md line 75-77)
- Async hooks: ✅ Correctly excluded (spec.md line 79-81)

### Check 5: Core Specification Issues

**Goal Alignment**: ✅ Matches user need
- Goal (line 3-5): "Standardize all DSL hooks...providing comprehensive data access"
- User need: "I want the dsl hooks to have a consistent api. I want to have access to the raw result, the processed result and the context"
- **PERFECT ALIGNMENT**

**User Stories**: ✅ Relevant and aligned
- Story 1 (line 8-22): Developer using DSL hooks - addresses consistency need
- Story 2 (line 24-30): Framework maintainer - addresses maintainability
- Both stories directly support the user's request for consistent API

**Core Requirements**: ✅ All from user discussion
- Signature standardization (line 36-39): From user's Option C choice
- Standard parameters (line 41-44): From user's context access requirement
- Hook-specific parameters (line 46-52): Includes raw_result, processed_result from user request
- All hooks covered (line 54-56): From user's "all hooks" answer

**Out of Scope**: ✅ Matches discussion
- No backward compatibility (line 66-69): User chose Option C (breaking change)
- Focused scope (line 72-81): Matches user's specific request

### Check 6: Task List Issues

**Task Specificity**: ✅ Each task references specific features
- Task 1.2: "Modify fire_dsl_hook method to build comprehensive data hash" - specific implementation
- Task 2.2-2.6: Lists specific line numbers for hook call sites
- Task 3.2-3.9: Specific HooksAdapter methods to update

**Traceability**: ✅ Each task traces back to requirements
- Task 1: Implements core fire_dsl_hook update (from spec.md line 108-130)
- Task 2: Updates all hook call sites (from technical-spec.md line 79-158)
- Task 3: Updates HooksAdapter (from technical-spec.md line 160-252)
- Task 4: Documentation (from spec requirement for standardization)
- Task 5: Testing (from user's "update existing tests" requirement)

**Scope**: ✅ No tasks for features not in requirements
- All tasks directly support the standardization goal
- No extraneous features added

**Visual Alignment**: N/A - No visual assets

**Task Count**: ✅ Within reasonable range
- 5 major task groups
- 36 total subtasks
- Appropriate for scope of breaking API change

**TDD Approach**: ✅ Tests first pattern
- Task 1.1: "Write tests for new fire_dsl_hook signature" BEFORE 1.2 implementation
- Task 2.1: "Write tests for each hook call site update" BEFORE 2.2-2.6 updates
- Task 3.1: "Write tests for HooksAdapter" BEFORE 3.2-3.10 implementation
- Tasks follow TDD pattern throughout

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

**N/A** - This is a core framework standardization, not creating new components. The spec is:
- Refactoring existing hook system
- Not creating new functionality
- Following established RAAF patterns
- No unnecessary complexity added

## Critical Issues
None found. Specification is ready for implementation.

## Minor Issues

1. **Missing requirements.md file**: ⚠️ Warning
   - Expected file at planning/requirements.md does not exist
   - User Q&A should be documented in requirements.md for future reference
   - Recommendation: Create requirements.md with Q&A conversation

2. **No explicit statement about "NO migration guide"**: ⚠️ Minor
   - Spec says "No dual-signature support period" but doesn't explicitly say "NO migration guide needed"
   - User specifically said "NO migration guide needed" in their answer
   - Technical spec includes migration guide (line 445-513)
   - Recommendation: Add note that migration examples are for reference only, not a formal migration guide

## Recommendations

1. Create planning/requirements.md with the Q&A conversation for documentation
2. Add explicit note in spec.md that migration examples are reference only, not a formal guide
3. Consider adding a "Breaking Changes" section to CHANGELOG template in spec

## Conclusion

**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

All specifications accurately reflect user requirements:
- ✅ Exact hook signature requested (Option C)
- ✅ All hooks covered (DSL + Core adapter)
- ✅ Breaking change clearly stated (no backward compatibility)
- ✅ Context access specified correctly (@context instance variable)
- ✅ Testing strategy matches request (update existing tests)
- ✅ Raw result, processed result, and context all accessible
- ✅ Technical spec provides clear implementation steps
- ✅ TDD approach followed throughout tasks

The specification is comprehensive, accurate, and ready for implementation. Only minor documentation improvements recommended (requirements.md file and migration guide clarification).

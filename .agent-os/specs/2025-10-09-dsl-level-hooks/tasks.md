# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-09-dsl-level-hooks/spec.md

> Created: 2025-10-09
> Status: In Progress - **Tier 1 COMPLETE** ‚úÖ | Tier 2 Partial (Circuit Breaker Hooks Pending)
> Last Updated: 2025-10-09

## Recent Progress (2025-10-09)

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Fixed anonymous class handling in prompt inference (added nil checks)
- Fixed hook execution context (changed from `hook.call` to `instance_exec`)
- Added 10 DSL hook methods to Agent class
- Updated HOOK_TYPES constant in Agent class
- Created comprehensive test suite (15 tests, all passing)
- **All Tier 1 COMPLETE** (on_context_built, on_validation_failed, on_result_ready)
- All Tier 2 tests passing (on_prompt_generated, on_tokens_counted)

**üìù Key Implementation Details:**
- Used `instance_exec` in `fire_dsl_hook()` to execute hook blocks in agent's context
- Added nil guards in `infer_prompt_class_name()` and `try_alternative_prompt_conventions()`
- Tests use direct `fire_dsl_hook()` calls to verify hook functionality
- Error handling test confirms hooks don't crash agent execution
- **on_validation_failed hook fires in error handling for SchemaError, ValidationError, and context validation errors**
- Hook receives error message, error_type (schema_validation, data_validation, or context_validation), field info when available

  - [ ] 3.3 Write tests for `on_execution_slow` hook with timing thresholds
  - [ ] 3.4 Add execution timing logic with `on_execution_slow` hook in `execute()` method
  - [ ] 3.5 Write tests for `on_pipeline_stage_complete` hook (if pipeline tracking exists)
  - [ ] 3.6 Implement pipeline stage tracking with hook execution
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify all Tier 3 tests pass

- [ ] 4. Integration Testing with Real Transformations
  - [ ] 4.1 Write integration test for complete agent lifecycle with all hooks firing
  - [ ] 4.2 Write integration test verifying hook execution order (context ‚Üí prompts ‚Üí tokens ‚Üí result)
  - [ ] 4.3 Write integration test confirming transformed data in `on_result_ready` vs raw data in `on_agent_end`
  - [ ] 4.4 Write backward compatibility tests for legacy agents without DSL hooks
  - [ ] 4.5 Write hybrid agent tests using both core and DSL hooks simultaneously
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all integration tests pass

- [ ] 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for hook errors (exceptions in hook blocks)
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement robust error handling in `fire_dsl_hook()` - log errors but don't crash agent
  - [ ] 5.3 Write tests for validation failures with multiple errors
  - [ ] 5.4 Write tests for missing token usage data (providers that don't return usage)
  - [ ] 5.5 Write tests for hooks with nil/empty data
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify all error handling tests pass

- [ ] 6. Documentation and Examples
  - [ ] 6.1 Update `dsl/CLAUDE.md` with "Core vs DSL Hooks" section
  - [ ] 6.2 Document execution order and data structure for each hook type

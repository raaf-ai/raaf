> Spec: Enhanced Agent Tracing UI with Comprehensive Data Visualization
> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing RAAF tracing system to capture comprehensive agent execution data including prompts, input/output context, schema information, chat conversations, and metadata. Provide a Rails engine with a modern web UI featuring collapsible, color-coded JSON viewers for detailed analysis and debugging of agent workflows.

## User Stories

### Complete Agent Execution Visibility

As a **RAAF developer**, I want to capture and view all agent call details including prompts, input context, output context, schema information, chat conversations, agent names, and execution timestamps, so that I can thoroughly debug agent workflows and understand system behavior.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer runs agent workflows and can immediately access a comprehensive dashboard showing complete execution traces. Each agent call displays full context data, allowing deep inspection of how data flows between agents and identifying issues in multi-agent pipelines.

### Interactive JSON Data Exploration  

As a **system administrator**, I want to selectively expand and collapse JSON output with syntax highlighting and color coding, so that I can efficiently navigate complex nested data structures and focus on specific aspects of agent execution.

**Detailed Workflow:** User opens the tracing dashboard and sees agent calls with collapsed JSON data. They can click to expand specific sections (input context, output context, schema) with proper syntax highlighting. Large data structures remain manageable through selective expansion, allowing focused debugging.

### Historical Analysis and Search

As a **product manager**, I want to search and filter historical agent executions by agent name, date range, status, and metadata, so that I can analyze performance trends and identify patterns in agent behavior over time.

**Detailed Workflow:** User accesses historical trace data through advanced search interface, filtering by date ranges, agent names, execution status, and custom metadata fields. Results display in paginated views with export capabilities for further analysis.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Data Collection** - Capture prompts, input/output context, schema, chat conversations, agent names, timestamps, and standard execution metadata for every agent call
2. **ActiveRecord Storage** - Store all enhanced tracing data in database tables with proper indexing and relationships  
3. **Rails Engine UI** - Modern web interface with responsive design for viewing and analyzing trace data
4. **Interactive JSON Viewer** - Collapsible, syntax-highlighted JSON display with color coding for different data types
5. **Search and Filtering** - Advanced search capabilities across all captured data with date range, agent name, and metadata filters

## Out of Scope

- Real-time streaming of trace data (future enhancement)
- Integration with external monitoring tools (existing processors handle this)
- Performance optimization beyond basic indexing (can be addressed separately)
- Export to formats other than JSON (current scope focuses on viewing)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced agent execution data** captured and stored in database with comprehensive details for debugging and analysis
2. **Modern web dashboard** accessible through Rails engine mount with intuitive navigation and responsive design  
3. **Interactive JSON viewer** allowing selective expansion/collapse of nested data structures with syntax highlighting

- Reusability Check: ✅ Passed (using TavilySearch pattern and RAAF Core modules)
- TDD Compliance: ✅ Passed (tests-first approach throughout)

## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
✅ All user requirements accurately captured:

**Error Context (from user):**
- User reported: `uninitialized constant RAAF::Tools::PerplexityTool`
- Error documented in spec.md user story "agent discovery and loading is reliable"
- Loading error problem addressed in Goal section

**Architecture Request (from user):**
- User requested: "I want the perplexity tool to be structured like the Tavily search tool, but still use the common API that's available in the RAAF core."
- Spec correctly identifies two key aspects:
  1. Self-contained structure (like TavilySearch)
  2. Integration with RAAF Core common modules
- Technical spec explicitly states "Follow TavilySearch pattern for consistency"
- Implementation plan references TavilySearch throughout

**Core Requirements Captured:**
- Remove raaf-tools gem dependency ✅
- Direct HTTP implementation like TavilySearch ✅
- Use RAAF::Perplexity::Common for validation ✅
- Use RAAF::Perplexity::SearchOptions for option building ✅
- Use RAAF::Perplexity::ResultParser for formatting ✅
- Maintain backward compatibility ✅

**Additional Context:**
- No additional notes provided by user
- All requirements derived from error context and architecture request

### Check 2: Visual Assets
⚠️ No visual assets found in planning/visuals folder
- Folder does not exist
- Not applicable for this technical refactoring spec
- No UI changes involved

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking

**Explicit Features Requested:**
1. ✅ Remove dependency on raaf-tools gem - Covered in Spec Scope #1
2. ✅ Direct HTTP implementation - Covered in Spec Scope #2
3. ✅ Use RAAF Core common modules - Covered in Spec Scope #3
4. ✅ Follow TavilySearch pattern - Covered throughout technical spec
5. ✅ Maintain backward compatibility - Covered in Spec Scope #4

**Constraints Stated:**
- ✅ Must use RAAF Core modules (not create new ones)

- ✅ Must follow TavilySearch self-contained pattern
- ✅ Must not depend on raaf-tools gem

**Out-of-Scope Items (correctly identified):**
- ✅ No public API changes
- ✅ No tool definition format changes
- ✅ No new features beyond current implementation
- ✅ No changes to DSL agent usage patterns
- ✅ No modifications to RAAF Core modules

**Reusability Opportunities:**

2. ✅ RAAF::Perplexity::Common - For model/filter validation
3. ✅ RAAF::Perplexity::SearchOptions - For option building
4. ✅ RAAF::Perplexity::ResultParser - For response formatting
5. ✅ Net::HTTP pattern from TavilySearch - For HTTP implementation

**Implicit Needs Addressed:**
- ✅ Error handling consistency with TavilySearch
- ✅ Logging patterns matching TavilySearch
- ✅ Tool definition structure following base pattern
- ✅ Performance requirements (no degradation)

### Check 5: Core Specification Validation

**1. Goal Alignment:**
✅ Goal directly addresses user's loading error problem:
- "Restructure... to be self-contained with direct HTTP implementation"
- Eliminates raaf-tools dependency that causes `uninitialized constant` error

**2. User Stories:**
✅ Both user stories trace to requirements:
- DSL Agent Developer story addresses the loading error
- Framework Maintainer story addresses the architecture request

**3. Core Requirements:**
✅ All 5 requirements directly from user needs:
1. Remove External Dependencies - From error context
2. Direct HTTP Implementation - From TavilySearch pattern request
3. Leverage Core Common Modules - From "use common API" request
4. Maintain Compatibility - Implicit need for refactoring
5. Comprehensive Testing - Best practice for refactoring

**4. Out of Scope:**
✅ Correctly excludes scope creep:
- No API changes (maintains compatibility)
- No new features (pure refactoring)
- No Core module modifications (use, don't change)

**5. Reusability Notes:**
✅ Excellent reusability documentation:
- TavilySearch as reference implementation
- All 3 RAAF Core Perplexity modules identified
- Clear integration points specified

### Check 6: Task List Detailed Validation

**1. TDD Approach:**
✅ Excellent test-first approach:
- Phase 1 (Task Group 1): Test foundation BEFORE implementation
- Task 1.1: Write tests for current implementation
- Task 1.4: Create backward compatibility suite
- Task 2.1: Write tests for new HTTP implementation
- Task 3.1: Write integration tests
- All implementation tasks have corresponding test tasks first

**2. Reusability References:**
✅ Strong reusability documentation:
- Task 1.3: "Study TavilySearch implementation pattern"
- Task 2.2: "Follow pattern from: TavilySearch"
- Task 2.4: All 3 Core modules referenced
- Task 3.3: "Use Core constants for model enums"
- Task 3.2: "Follow TavilySearch logging pattern"

**3. Specificity:**
✅ Highly specific tasks with clear deliverables:
- Task 2.2: Specific requires to add/remove
- Task 2.3: Specific methods to implement
- Task 2.4: Specific Core modules to integrate
- Task 3.1: Specific test scenarios listed
- Task 3.2: Specific logging requirements

**4. Traceability:**
✅ All tasks trace to requirements:
- Tasks 1.x → Testing requirement
- Tasks 2.x → Direct HTTP + Core integration requirements
- Tasks 3.x → API compatibility + integration requirements
- Tasks 4.x → Comprehensive testing + cleanup requirements

**5. Scope:**
✅ No out-of-scope tasks:
- All tasks focus on restructuring
- No feature additions
- No Core module modifications
- Maintains backward compatibility

**6. Visual Alignment:**
N/A - No visual files for this technical spec

**7. Task Count:**
✅ Appropriate task distribution:
- Task Group 1: 5 subtasks (Test Foundation)
- Task Group 2: 6 subtasks (Core Implementation)
- Task Group 3: 6 subtasks (API Integration)
- Task Group 4: 5 subtasks (Finalization)
- Total: 4 groups × 5-6 tasks = 22 subtasks
- Within 3-10 tasks per group guideline

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

**1. Unnecessary New Components:**
✅ No unnecessary new components:
- Using existing RAAF Core modules
- Following established TavilySearch pattern
- No new validation logic (using Common)
- No new parsers (using ResultParser)

**2. Duplicated Logic:**
✅ Eliminates duplication:
- Removes duplicate VALID_MODELS constants
- Removes duplicate VALID_RECENCY_FILTERS
- Uses Core validation instead of local copies
- Implementation plan explicitly removes duplicates (Step 2)

**3. Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
✅ All reuse opportunities captured:
- TavilySearch pattern documented
- All 3 Core modules identified
- HTTP implementation reuses Net::HTTP stdlib
- Tool definition structure reuses Base class

**4. Justification for New Code:**
✅ Clear justification for all new code:
- HTTP implementation: Required to replace raaf-tools wrapper
- Request building: Required for direct API calls
- Error handling: Required for self-contained operation
- All justified by removing external dependency

## Critical Issues
None found. ✅ The specification is ready for implementation.

## Minor Issues
None found. ✅ The specification is comprehensive and well-structured.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
None found. ✅ The spec appropriately uses existing patterns and modules.

**Specifically avoided over-engineering:**
- Not creating new validation logic (using Core)
- Not creating new parsers (using Core)
- Not adding features (pure refactoring)
- Not creating new patterns (following TavilySearch)

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Excellent TDD Approach**: The test-first approach in Phase 1 is exemplary
2. ✅ **Strong Reusability**: TavilySearch pattern and Core modules well-documented
3. ✅ **Clear Dependencies**: Task dependencies properly ordered
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple test phases with specific scenarios
5. ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Strong focus on maintaining API contract

**Additional Suggestions (Optional):**
- Consider adding a migration checklist for users (though spec is backward compatible)
- Consider adding performance benchmarks comparing old vs new implementation
- Both suggestions are minor enhancements; spec is complete as-is

## Conclusion

✅ **Ready for Implementation**

The specification accurately reflects all user requirements:
- Addresses the loading error problem
- Follows TavilySearch pattern as requested
- Uses RAAF Core common modules as requested
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Includes comprehensive testing strategy

**Strengths:**
1. Excellent TDD approach with tests before implementation
2. Strong reusability leveraging TavilySearch pattern and Core modules
3. Clear task breakdown with proper dependencies
4. Comprehensive testing coverage across all phases
5. No scope creep or over-engineering

**No blocking issues found. Implementation can proceed.**

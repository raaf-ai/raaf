> Spec: RAAF Tracing Span Details Display
> Created: 2025-09-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the RAAF tracing span detail UI to display span information in a clear, organized format. Focus specifically on showing span attributes, timing information, and metadata in an intuitive interface that helps developers understand individual span details.

## User Stories

### Developer Span Analysis

As a developer debugging RAAF tracing issues, I want to see detailed span information including attributes, timing, and metadata in a well-organized format, so that I can understand span execution and identify issues.

**Detailed Workflow**: Navigate to span detail page â†’ View span attributes in organized sections â†’ Review timing information and duration â†’ Inspect metadata and context â†’ Understand span execution flow â†’ Identify performance or error issues.

### Operations Team Monitoring

As an operations team member monitoring RAAF performance, I want to quickly access detailed span information in a clear visual format, so that I can understand system behavior and troubleshoot issues.

**Detailed Workflow**: Access span detail from monitoring dashboard â†’ Review span overview and status â†’ Examine detailed attributes and timing â†’ Identify performance bottlenecks or errors â†’ Take corrective actions as needed.

## Spec Scope

1. **Span Overview Display** - Universal header showing span ID, trace ID, parent span, name, kind, status, and timing information for all span types.

2. **Type-Specific Components** - Dedicated components for each span kind (tool, agent, llm, handoff, guardrail, pipeline) with specialized data visualization appropriate for each type.

3. **Tool Span Visualization** - Enhanced display showing function name, input parameters, output results, and execution flow with clear input/output separation.

4. **Agent/LLM Span Details** - Display of agent configuration, model details, token usage, and cost information with performance metrics.

5. **Component Routing System** - Smart component selection based on span.kind that renders the appropriate specialized component.

6. **Modern UI Components** - Consistent design using existing Preline UI components across all span types with shared JavaScript functionality.

## Out of Scope

- Real-time span updates or WebSocket functionality
- Span editing or modification capabilities
- Advanced analytics or span search features
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Span export to formats other than JSON
- User authentication or permission controls (handled at application level)
- Conversation dialog display (focus is on span data only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced span detail page** with type-specific components that automatically render appropriate visualization based on span.kind, providing specialized views for each span type.

2. **Dedicated span type components** including ToolSpanComponent, AgentSpanComponent, LlmSpanComponent, HandoffSpanComponent, GuardrailSpanComponent, and PipelineSpanComponent with specialized data displays.

3. **Interactive type-specific visualizations** with expand/collapse functionality tailored to each span type's data structure, showing relevant information like tool parameters/results, agent configurations, or LLM usage metrics.

# Task Group 5: Documentation and Examples - Implementation Report

## Overview

Successfully created comprehensive documentation and migration guides for the lazy tool loading and DSL consolidation feature. All deprecated `uses_*` methods have been documented with clear migration paths, and all example code has been updated to use the new unified `tool` API.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Migration Guide (MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

Created a comprehensive migration guide with:
- **Overview** explaining the benefits (6.25x performance improvement)
- **Key Changes** summary highlighting API simplification
- **Breaking Changes** table listing all 7 removed methods
- **Migration Patterns** with before/after examples for all 7 patterns:
  1. Single tool registration
  2. Multiple tools at once
  3. Native tool classes
  4. Tool with options
  5. Tool with alias
  6. Conditional tool loading
  7. Inline tool definition
- **Step-by-Step Migration Process** with grep commands
- **Common Migration Issues** and solutions
- **Testing Your Migration** with example specs
- **Performance Verification** instructions
- **Rollback Plan** for safety

### 2. Changelog Entry (CHANGELOG.md)

Added version 2.0.0 entry with:
- **Breaking Changes** section clearly marked with ⚠️
- **Removed** section listing all deprecated methods
- **Added** section documenting new features:
  - Lazy tool loading
  - Unified `tool` and `tools` methods
  - Enhanced error messages
  - Automatic namespace search
- **Performance Improvements** with specific metrics
- **Migration Guide** reference
- **Technical Details** for developers

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updates

Enhanced documentation with new "Tool Registration (v2.0.0+)" section:
- **Unified Tool API** introduction with examples
- **All 7 Registration Patterns** with code snippets
- **Lazy Loading Benefits** with performance comparison
- **Tool Resolution** explaining namespace search
- **Enhanced Error Messages** with example output
- **Migration from Old Syntax** link

Note: Task Group 2 had already updated the basic tool syntax in Quick Start section.

### 4. Example Files Updated

Fixed deprecated method usage in:
- `run_agent_example.rb` - Changed `uses_tool` to `tool`
- `swarm_style_agent_example.rb` - Changed 2 instances of `uses_tool` to `tool`
- `web_search_agent.rb` - Changed 3 instances of `uses_tool` to `tool`

### 5. README.md Updates

Updated all examples to use new syntax:
- Fixed 8 instances of `uses_tool` → `tool`
- Fixed 2 instances of `uses_tool_if` → `tool ... if condition`
- Updated conditional patterns to use Ruby syntax

### 6. Documentation Tests (documentation_spec.rb)

Created comprehensive test suite verifying:
- All migration guide examples work
- All CLAUDE.md examples work
- All README.md examples work
- Deprecated methods raise NoMethodError
- Performance characteristics of lazy loading
- Error messages are helpful

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `dsl/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration guide (230 lines)
2. `dsl/spec/documentation_spec.rb` - Documentation test suite (325 lines)
3. This report file

### Modified
1. `dsl/CHANGELOG.md` - Added v2.0.0 entry with breaking changes
2. `dsl/CLAUDE.md` - Added comprehensive tool registration section
3. `dsl/README.md` - Updated all examples to new syntax
4. `dsl/examples/run_agent_example.rb` - Fixed deprecated method
5. `dsl/examples/swarm_style_agent_example.rb` - Fixed 2 deprecated methods
6. `dsl/examples/web_search_agent.rb` - Fixed 3 deprecated methods
7. `tasks.md` - Marked Task Group 5 as complete

## Verification

All documentation has been:
- ✅ Written with clear, actionable instructions
- ✅ Provided with working code examples
- ✅ Tested via documentation_spec.rb
- ✅ Cross-referenced between documents
- ✅ Formatted consistently with project standards

## Migration Support

The documentation provides multiple levels of support:
1. **Quick Reference** - Simple replacement table
2. **Detailed Examples** - All 7 patterns with before/after
3. **Step-by-Step Process** - Systematic migration approach
4. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
5. **Rollback Plan** - Safety net if issues arise

## Performance Documentation

Clearly documented the performance benefits:
- 6.25x faster initialization (37.50ms → 6.00ms for 100 agents)
- ~40% memory reduction during initialization
- Tools loaded only when needed, not eagerly

## Conclusion

Task Group 5 is complete. All documentation has been created, all examples updated, and comprehensive migration support provided. The documentation emphasizes both the simplicity of the new API and the significant performance benefits achieved through lazy loading.

Developers migrating from the old API have clear guidance, working examples, and troubleshooting support. The breaking changes are well-documented in multiple places (CHANGELOG, MIGRATION_GUIDE, and error messages) to ensure no one is caught off-guard.

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**RAAF::Tracing::TracingRegistry**
- Test with_tracer properly sets and restores context
- Test current_tracer returns correct tracer from hierarchy
- Test thread isolation - different threads have separate contexts
- Test fiber isolation - different fibers can have separate contexts
- Test nested context handling with proper cleanup
- Test process-level tracer configuration and fallback

**RAAF::Tracing::NoOpTracer**
- Test NoOpTracer behavior and performance characteristics
- Test all tracer interface methods return appropriate no-op values
- Test performance - should have near-zero overhead
- Test method_missing handling for unknown tracer methods

**RAAF::Runner (raaf-core gem)**
- Test auto-detection of registry tracer when none provided explicitly
- Test explicit tracer parameter takes precedence over registry tracer
- Test graceful fallback when TracingRegistry not available
- Test that existing runner behavior is unchanged
- Test get_default_tracer method includes TracingRegistry lookup
- Test cross-gem integration with conditional requires

**RAAF::Tracing::Traceable (raaf-tracing gem)**
- Test get_tracer_for_span_sending includes TracingRegistry in priority order
- Test existing tracer discovery priority is maintained
- Test TracingRegistry tracers are discovered automatically
- Test backward compatibility with existing Traceable usage

**RAAF::NoOpTracer**
- Test all tracer interface methods return appropriate no-op values
- Test performance - should have near-zero overhead
- Test span creation returns NoOpSpan instances
- Test method_missing handling for unknown tracer methods

### Integration Tests

**TracingRegistry Context Flow**
- Test complete trace creation flow from middleware to agent execution
- Test trace span hierarchy is maintained through registry context
- Test multiple agents in single registry context create proper parent-child relationships
- Test handoff between agents preserves registry trace context
- Test tool execution creates child spans under registry trace
- Test DSL Pipeline integration with TracingRegistry
- Test DSL Agent integration with TracingRegistry

**Thread Safety**
- Test concurrent requests with different registry contexts remain isolated
- Test async operations (fibers) inherit and maintain separate contexts
- Test context cleanup doesn't affect other threads/fibers
- Test nested contexts work correctly in multi-threaded environments

**Framework Integration**
- Test Rails middleware integration creates proper request spans
- Test generic Rack middleware works with any Rack application
- Test framework integration maintains trace context throughout request lifecycle

### Mocking Requirements

- **Thread.current and Fiber.current:** Mock to test context isolation and cleanup behavior
- **RAAF::Tracing::SpanTracer:** Mock to verify tracer creation and method calls
- **Framework middleware environments:** Mock Rack env, Rails request objects

### Performance Tests

**Overhead Measurement**
- Benchmark NoOpTracer overhead vs no tracing at all
- Benchmark ambient context lookup performance
- Benchmark context setting/cleanup overhead
- Memory usage analysis for ambient context storage

**Load Testing**
- Test ambient tracing under high concurrency loads
- Test memory cleanup under sustained operation
- Test thread pool behavior with ambient contexts

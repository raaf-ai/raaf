# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: RAAF Tracing Registry
> Created: 2025-09-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a tracing registry in RAAF that automatically detects and uses trace context without requiring explicit tracer configuration in services or controllers. This feature will make RAAF tracing transparent and reusable across any Ruby application framework.

## User Stories

### Framework-Agnostic Tracing

As a RAAF library user, I want tracing to work automatically without framework-specific knowledge, so that I can use RAAF in any Ruby application (Rails, Sinatra, plain Ruby) with consistent tracing behavior.

Users should be able to configure tracing once at the application level and have all RAAF agents automatically participate in traces without explicit tracer passing or configuration in business logic.

### Zero-Configuration Agent Tracing

As a developer using RAAF agents, I want my agents to automatically participate in traces when tracing is active, so that I don't need to modify my agent code or service logic to get observability.

Agents should automatically discover registered tracers and create appropriate spans without requiring explicit tracer parameters or configuration changes to existing code.

### Framework Integration Simplicity

As a framework developer, I want to integrate RAAF tracing with a simple middleware or configuration, so that all RAAF operations within my framework automatically become traceable without per-request setup.

Framework integrations should be plug-and-play with minimal configuration and should follow each framework's conventions for middleware and lifecycle management.

## Spec Scope

1. **Tracing Registry Core** - Thread-safe registry for automatic tracer storage and retrieval
2. **Auto-Detection in Runner** - Modify RAAF Runner to automatically use registered tracer when no explicit tracer provided
3. **Framework Integration Adapters** - Reusable middleware patterns for Rails and generic Ruby applications
4. **Traceable Module Integration** - Update existing Traceable module to automatically discover registry tracers
5. **No-Op Tracing** - Graceful degradation when tracing is disabled with zero performance impact
6. **Context Propagation** - Support for async operations, fibers, and multi-threaded environments

## Out of Scope

- Custom trace storage backends (use existing RAAF tracing processors)
- Breaking changes to existing RAAF Runner API
- Framework-specific trace correlation features beyond basic request/job identification
- Advanced distributed tracing features (focus on single-process ambient context)

## Expected Deliverable

1. RAAF agents automatically participate in traces when tracing registry is active without code changes
2. Framework middleware can be added to Rails or any Ruby app to enable automatic tracing
3. Existing RAAF code works unchanged - ambient tracing is purely additive functionality

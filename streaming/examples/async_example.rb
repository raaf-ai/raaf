# This example demonstrates concurrent agent execution in RAAF (Ruby AI Agents Factory).
# Concurrent operations enable parallel processing, improved performance, and better
# resource utilization when dealing with multiple agents or time-consuming tools.
# The concurrency functionality uses Ruby's Concurrent Ruby gem and built-in
# threading capabilities to provide efficient parallel execution.

# CONCURRENT AGENT EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: This example requires the 'concurrent-ruby' gem to be installed:
# gem install concurrent-ruby

# ============================================================================
# AGENT SETUP
# ============================================================================
# Create an agent that will be used with concurrent execution patterns.
# While the agent itself isn't inherently async, we can execute multiple
# agents concurrently for parallel processing.

agent = RAAF::Agent.new(
  name: "ConcurrentAssistant",
  
  # Instructions guide the agent's behavior
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can search for information and perform calculations.",
  
  # Using smaller model for faster responses in examples
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
)

# ============================================================================
# CONCURRENT TOOLS
# ============================================================================
# Define tools that simulate time-consuming operations like API calls.
# While individual tool calls aren't async, we can execute multiple agents
# concurrently to achieve parallel processing.

# Tool 1: Search function simulating external API call
# In production: would call search APIs, databases, or web services
def search_tool(query:)
  puts "[Search] Starting search for: #{query}"
  sleep(1) # Simulate API latency (would be actual API call)
  puts "[Search] Completed search for: #{query}"
  "Search results for '#{query}': Found 10 relevant articles about #{query}."
end

agent.add_tool(method(:search_tool))

# Tool 2: Calculator simulating complex computation
# Shows how concurrency allows other operations while calculating
def calculate_tool(expression:)
  puts "[Calculate] Starting calculation: #{expression}"
  sleep(0.5) # Simulate computation time
  
  # Safe evaluation with error handling
  result = begin
    # In production: use a proper expression parser
    eval(expression)
  rescue StandardError
    "Invalid expression"
  end
  
  puts "[Calculate] Completed calculation: #{expression} = #{result}"
  "Result: #{result}"
end

agent.add_tool(method(:calculate_tool))

# Tool 3: Weather service with highest latency
# Demonstrates benefit of concurrency when dealing with slow services
def weather_tool(location:)
  puts "[Weather] Fetching weather for: #{location}"
  sleep(1.5) # Simulate slow weather API
  puts "[Weather] Completed weather fetch for: #{location}"
  "The weather in #{location} is sunny and 72Â°F."
end

agent.add_tool(method(:weather_tool))

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE 1: SIMPLE AGENT EXECUTION
# ============================================================================
# Shows basic agent execution with tool calls.
# While individual tool calls are sequential, we can run multiple agents
# concurrently in the next examples.

# Demonstrates running multiple specialized agents concurrently using threads.
# This pattern is powerful for decomposing complex tasks.

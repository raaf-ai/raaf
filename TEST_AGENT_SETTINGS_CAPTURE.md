# Agent Settings Capture & Display - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Temperature and all other agent settings are now **fully captured and displayed** in the Rails spans UI. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Agent Collector** - Captures 9 model settings from agent.model_settings
2. **DSL Agent Collector** - Captures model settings from DSL configuration
3. **Rails UI Component** - Displays all settings with conditional rendering

## What's Now Captured

When agents execute, these settings are automatically captured in span attributes:

```
agent.temperature           (from model_settings[:temperature])
agent.max_tokens            (from model_settings[:max_tokens])
agent.top_p                 (from model_settings[:top_p])
agent.frequency_penalty     (from model_settings[:frequency_penalty])
agent.presence_penalty      (from model_settings[:presence_penalty])
agent.tool_choice           (from agent.tool_choice attribute)
agent.parallel_tool_calls   (from model_settings[:parallel_tool_calls])
agent.response_format       (from agent.response_format attribute)
agent.model_settings_json   (complete settings as JSON)
```

## How to Test

### 1. Create an Agent with Model Settings

```ruby
# In Rails console or test:
agent = RAAF::Agent.new(
  name: "TestAgent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant",
  model: "gpt-4o",
  model_settings: {
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 2000,
    top_p: 0.95,
    frequency_penalty: 0.1,
    presence_penalty: 0.05,
    parallel_tool_calls: true
  },
  tool_choice: "auto",
  response_format: { type: "json_schema", schema: { properties: {} } }
)

# Run the agent with tracing
tracer = RAAF::Tracing::SpanTracer.new
tracer.add_processor(RAAF::Tracing::ActiveRecordProcessor.new)

runner = RAAF::Runner.new(agent: agent, tracer: tracer)
result = runner.run("Hello!")
```

### 2. View in Rails Dashboard

After execution:
1. Navigate to `/raaf/tracing/spans`
2. Click on the agent span (ProspectScoringAgent or similar)
3. Scroll to "Agent Configuration" section
4. You'll see:
   ```
   Agent Name              ProspectScoringAgent
   Model                   gpt-4o
   Execution Status        ✓ Ok
   Duration                37.2s

   Temperature             0.7
   Max Tokens              2000
   Top P                   0.95

   Frequency Penalty       0.1
   Presence Penalty        0.05

   Tools Available         3
   Tool Choice             "auto"
   Parallel Tool Calls     Enabled

   Response Format         {"type":"json_schema",...}
   ```

## Files Modified

### 1. Core AgentCollector
**File:** `raaf/tracing/lib/raaf/tracing/span_collectors/agent_collector.rb`

- Added 9 new span capture definitions (lines 60-132)
- Captures all model settings from agent.model_settings
- Handles nil values gracefully with "N/A" defaults
- Supports both symbol and string keys

### 2. DSL AgentCollector
**File:** `raaf/tracing/lib/raaf/tracing/span_collectors/dsl/agent_collector.rb`

- Extended to capture 8 model settings (lines 70-106)
- Extracts settings from DSL _context_config
- Matches core agent collector for consistency

### 3. Rails UI Component
**File:** `raaf/rails/app/components/raaf/rails/tracing/agent_span_component.rb`

- Updated agent_config extraction (lines 217-229)
- Enhanced render_agent_configuration (lines 246-301)
- Added conditional rendering for each setting
- Organized settings into logical sections:
  - Basic Information
  - Core Model Parameters
  - Penalty Parameters
  - Tool Configuration
  - Response Configuration

## Why Existing Spans Don't Show Settings

The ProspectScoringAgent span you're viewing was **created before these changes were deployed**. Existing spans in the database have no settings data because the collectors didn't capture them at that time.

**Next agent executions will capture all settings automatically.**

## Display Logic

The UI only displays settings that:
1. Have actual values (not "N/A")
2. Are different from defaults (tools_count != "0", etc.)
3. Are present in the span attributes

This keeps the display clean and focused on relevant configuration.

## Example: What You'll See in New Spans

```
Agent Configuration

Basic Information
├── Agent Name: ProspectScoringAgent
├── Model: gpt-4o
├── Execution Status: ✓ Ok
└── Duration: 37.2s

Core Model Parameters
├── Temperature: 0.7
├── Max Tokens: 2000
└── Top P: 0.95

Penalty Parameters
├── Frequency Penalty: 0.1
└── Presence Penalty: 0.05

Tool Configuration
├── Tools Available: 3
├── Tool Choice: "auto"
└── Parallel Tool Calls: Enabled

Response Configuration
└── Response Format: {"type":"json_schema",...}
```

## Verification Checklist

✅ **Collectors Updated:**
- Core agent collector captures model settings
- DSL agent collector captures model settings
- Both handle nil values gracefully

✅ **UI Component Updated:**
- agent_config extracts all settings
- render_agent_configuration displays all settings
- Conditional rendering prevents clutter

✅ **Fallback Handling:**
- Extracts from multiple key formats (agent.*, dsl::agent.*)
- Returns "N/A" for missing settings
- Filters out "N/A" values from display

✅ **Data Preservation:**
- Complete model_settings_json captured for inspection
- All settings available in span_attributes JSONB
- Can be queried/analyzed via database

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: New agent executions will automatically capture settings
2. **Monitor Dashboard**: Watch `/raaf/tracing/spans` for new spans with full configuration
3. **Database Query**: Can query existing spans for settings:
   ```sql
   SELECT span_id, span_attributes->>'agent.temperature' as temperature,
          span_attributes->>'agent.max_tokens' as max_tokens
   FROM raaf_rails_tracing_span_records
   WHERE span_attributes->>'agent.temperature' IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

## Benefits

✨ **Complete Observability**: See exactly how agents are configured
✨ **Debugging**: Quickly identify configuration issues
✨ **Cost Analysis**: Track max_tokens usage
✨ **Compliance**: Audit trail of model parameters per execution
✨ **Performance Tuning**: Compare configurations across spans

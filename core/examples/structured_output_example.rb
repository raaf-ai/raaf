# ============================================================================
# SCHEMA DEFINITION
# ============================================================================
# Define a JSON Schema for product information using Ruby DSL.
# This schema enforces data structure, types, and validation rules.
# The DSL provides a clean, readable way to define complex schemas.

product_schema = RAAF::StructuredOutput::ObjectSchema.build do
  # String field with minimum length validation
  # required: true means this field must be present in the output
  string :name, required: true, minLength: 1

  # Basic required string field for product description
  string :description, required: true

  # Number field with minimum value constraint
  # Ensures prices are never negative
  number :price, required: true, minimum: 0

  # Enum field restricts values to a specific set
  # Perfect for categorization with known options
  string :category, enum: %w[electronics clothing food other], required: true

  # Array field with typed items and minimum count
  # Ensures at least one feature is always provided
  array :features, items: { type: "string" }, minItems: 1, required: true

  # Boolean field for binary states
  boolean :in_stock, required: true
